I am a postdoctoral fellow working on multidisciplinary projects involving climate change and sustainability. My research combines software engineering and modeling and simulation. I also work as a Contract Instructor at Carleton University teaching Data Science and Software Engineering (Requirement Elicitation, Data Structures, and Model-Driven Engineering). 

I received my Ph.D. degree from Carleton University in 2018 in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Software Engineering, a thesis focused on model-based testing and a minor in operations research. 

Before moving to academia, I have gained industrial experience through working as a software developer, software team lead, and project manager. I have received several training and certificates in software engineering, management, entrepreneurship, university teaching, and course design.
