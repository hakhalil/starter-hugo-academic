I am an Adjunct Research Professor at Carleton University. My research work covers Software Engineering, Data Science, and Modeling & Simulation. My work has been published in top peer-reviewed journals and conferences. I have received multiple scholarships and awards for achievements including the W.B. McDermid Holbein Memorial award. In addition to my involvement in academia, I have considerable experience in the software industry. Besides my academic roles, I currently work as a Senior Project Engineer for the Government of Canada.

I am also experienced in designing and developing pedagogy for graduate and undergraduate courses. Since 2019, I have been designing curricula, developing course material, and teaching Data Science and Software Engineering at the graduate and undergraduate levels. I have earned several certificates in designing courses and teaching at the university level. I adopt various strategies of experiential 
learning and I promote bridging the gap between industry and academia through my teaching and collaborative efforts. In 2022, I received Carleton Universityâ€™s teaching achievement award for my effort in this area. Furthermore, I have different volunteering roles and contributions to the IEEE Women in Engineering publications, Technovation, and the Ontario Women in Engineering organization.

I received my Ph.D. degree from Carleton University in 2018 in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Software Engineering, a minor in Operations Research.
