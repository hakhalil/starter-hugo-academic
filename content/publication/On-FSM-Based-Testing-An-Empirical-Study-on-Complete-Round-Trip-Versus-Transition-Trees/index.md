abstract: "Finite state machines being intuitively
understandable and suitable for modeling in many domains, they
are adopted by many software designers. Therefore, testing
systems that are modeled with state machines has received
genuine attention. Among the studied testing strategies are
complete round-trip paths and transition trees that cover roundtrip
paths in a piece wise manner. We present an empirical study
that aims at comparing the effectiveness of the complete roundtrip
paths test suites to the transition trees test suites in one hand,
and comparing the effectiveness of the different techniques used
to generate transition trees (breadth first traversal, depth first
traversal, and random traversal) on the other hand. We also
compare the effectiveness of all the testing trees generated using
each single traversal criterion. This is done through conducting
an empirical evaluation using four case studies from different
domains. Effectiveness is evaluated with mutants. Experimental
results are presented and analyzed."
