abstract: "Measuring Carbon Dioxide and studying its diffusion indoors has many applications, which include, but not limited to, maintaining air quality, conserving energy, and minimizing viral infections. On the one hand, many of the experiments needed to conduct studies, like the indoor diffusion of Carbon Dioxide, are complex to implement. On the other hand, adjusting each model manually to mimic the studied space is difficult and prone to error. We propose an automation tool for modeling, simulating, and visualizing Carbon Dioxide. The tool automates the simulation of Cellular Discrete Event Simulation models of Carbon Dioxide dispersion indoors. We discuss the toolâ€™s applications, the software architecture, related tools, and a case study. The case study compares simulations of a closed space with different configurations. The results show how such configurations affect Carbon Dioxide concentration."
