abstract: "With the global warming crisis and its correlation to levels of energy consumption, it is paramount to find ways to reduce energy consumption in closed spaces with minimal disruption to occupants' comfort. Thus, researchers are working to improve methodologies for occupant-based demand-control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Sensor usage for occupancy detection is among the methodologies researched for controlling consumption. Carbon dioxide sensors proved to be effective but overly sensitive to configuration. Research also proved that there is an undetermined latency period between the changes of the number of occupants and the carbon dioxide sensors detection of that change. We present a work in progress method to determine the best placement of carbon dioxide sensors for the accurate occupants' detection and calculation of latency using the Cellular Discrete-Event Specifications formalism. We present several case studies showing resemblance between physical closed spaces and the models and how the simulation replicates real-life scenarios."
