abstract: "The spread of viral particles as a primary cause of infection
indoors is an open problem under investigation. Physical
experimentation for studying infection spread in variable
indoor configurations are very complex; instead, modeling
and simulation provide a way to conduct the required studies
in a safe environment. We present a method for modeling,
simulating, and visualizing the infection risks in closed
spaces. We present models to estimate the dynamics of
indoor infection under different conditions. We use Cellular
Discrete Event Specifications and integrate the results with
Building Information Modeling."
