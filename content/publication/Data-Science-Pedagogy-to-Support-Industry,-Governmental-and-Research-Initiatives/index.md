publication: "Proceedings of the 2022 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on SPLASH-E"
publication_short: "SPLASH-E 2022"

abstract: "The SPLASH-E symposium is a forum for researchers and educators to discuss the intersection of education and the core SPLASH research areas: systems, pro- gramming languages, and their applications. We investigate how to deliver systems and programming languages concepts to students, how systems and languages can aid in education broadly, and how to prepare students to apply these concepts to their later work in industry or academia.

This year's SPLASH-E program includes 8 papers (five long, three short). This year's program covers a wide gamut of SPLASH-E topics: various techniques for improving introductory learning; instructor support for course management; experience reports; general computer science education; and education in specific languages and programming language concepts."
